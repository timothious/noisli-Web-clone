                        Staying focused at work is more and more a challenge. Frequent interruptions, mainly in form of
                        noise, are breaking our focus, increasing our stress level and lowering our productivity.

                        <br>
                        Use Noisli to drown out the overall office noise, distracting phone conversations and the
                        general chatter from other people. Use our Timer to help you work in sessions to maximise your
                        efficiency and prevent burnout.

                        Noisli works also great to create an inspiring atmosphere that can boost your motivation and
                        help you think more creatively. Background sounds help your mind from wandering around and keep
                        you concentrated on your task at hand.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Working from home requires a lot of self-discipline as you find yourself in an environment that
                        you associate with your private time and which is full of distractions inviting you to
                        procrastinate.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Most of the time it is also too quiet. Every spike in noise, being it maybe your neighbours or
                        your family members, can bring you out of focus.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A lot of us turned on the TV or the radio to keep us company and to indirectly mask other
                        noises, but these tools are not designed to do so and rather seek for our attention. Noisli is
                        the better option to drown out sudden noises and to help you create an inspiring work
                        environment at home. You can either stream Noisli through your speakers or use it with
                        headphones to drown out annoying noises

                        outside distractions such as phone or social media notifications and to study in a more
                        efficient way.<br>

                        Noisli is also powerful in class, as it allows students to find a calm space among all the other
                        classmates. You can use Noisli to enhance individual concentration or to fuel creative writing
                        by creating an inspiring atmosphere.

                        in the air, peace and calm is a rarity in such busy environments. You find yourself in ever
                        changing, buzzing places, where the noise environment around you is out of your control.

                        Being in nature is one of the best ways to relax, relieve stress and refuel our batteries. If
                        you don’t have the chance to be in nature in moments when you need it, you can use Noisli to
                        bring nature to you.
                        Background sounds of nature are especially stress relieving as we associate them with relaxation
                        and calmness. But also being transported onto a cozy train ride while sipping a cup of coffee
                        can be very relaxing.

                        Noisli allows you to choose what works best for you and adapt it to your needs, no matter if
                        you’re having a 10 minute break at work, or if you want to wind down after a stressful day. Of
                        course you can use Noisli also to create a special atmosphere in your home to enjoy your time
                        alone, or with your friends and family.

                        Being a good sleeper is the starting point to enjoy your day and to get the most out of it. The
                        noise of the city or your wandering mind can leave you laying in bed for several hours without
                        being able to fall asleep.

                        The masking abilities of background sounds can once again help you to mask annoying noises such
                        as the neighbours next door or the environment outside.
                        Don’t forget that background sounds can be very soothing also for the little ones

                        Why Noisli works
                    </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Silence and loud noises are usually associated with danger, thus making us alert. It is the
                        opposite of what we need when we want to focus or relax.
                        Background noise on the other hand is a sound that doesn’t contain spikes in volume, that is
                        very constant and rather predictable keeping therefore our inner alarm systems calm.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Moreover, due to the high amount of different frequencies contained, background sounds have
                        great masking abilities, reducing the negative impact of sudden spikes in external noise in our
                        environment. While listening to such background sounds, every additional noise adds to the
                        sounds you’re already hearing and doesn’t stand out so much anymore. Therefore, additional
                        noises are blended in and you don’t perceive them as disturbing as you normally would. This is
                        also why music with lyrics can bring us easily out of focus, especially when having to deal with
                        tasks that involve writing or reading. Music tends to be more rhythmic and unpredictable and if
                        it contains lyrics, it will easily mess with your concentration and shift your focus to the
                        lyrics instead of the task at hand.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, the right amount of background noise, not too quiet and not too loud, can also help you
                        to think in a more abstract way enhancing creative thinking.
